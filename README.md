# Abstract-Sequence-Classification-NLP
The goal of this project is to build a hybrid NLP model (RNNs, BERT) to classify medical abstract sentences into the role they play (e.g. objective, methods, results, etc) to enable researchers to effectively skim through the literature and dive deeper when necessary.
